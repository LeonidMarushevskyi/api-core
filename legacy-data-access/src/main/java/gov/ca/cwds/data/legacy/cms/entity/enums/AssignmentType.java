/**
 * The enum representing ASSIGNMENT.TYPE_OF_ASSIGNMENT_CODE from legacy system.
 * This indicator specifies who has the lead role in carrying out the responsibilities of
 * the CASE or REFERRAL. The primary assignment can be made to either the case working STAFF_PERSON
 * or to an OUT_OF_STATE_CONTACT_PARTY. There may be many ASSIGNMENTs considered to be "primary"
 * over the life of the CASE or REFERRAL, but only one of them is current at any time. An ASSIGNMENT
 * can be either designated as Primary (P), Secondary (S), or Read Only (R). Primary assigned workers
 * have the capability to retrieve, read, and update any case or referral to which they have direct
 * or indirect assignment. Similarly, Secondary assigned workers also have the same capabilities
 * to retrieve, read, and update any case or referral to which they have direct or indirect assignment.
 * In fact, Secondary workers for the most part have the same capabilities as the Primary worker,
 * but occasionally there are business rules in the application which prohibit the Secondary worker
 * from doing something that the Primary worker can do (i.e. requesting the closure of
 * an Adoptions Case). Read Only assigned workers have the capability to access and read any case
 * or referral to which they have direct or indirect assignment, but they do not have update capability.
